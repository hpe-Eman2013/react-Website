            <ul className="mb-0">
              <li>
                <strong>Concept:</strong> A Trust is a fiduciary relationship
                where one party holds the “Legal Title” for the benefit of
                another.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scriptural Reference:</strong> Tehillim (Psalms) 24:1 —
                “The earth is Yahuah’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
                they that dwell therein.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In-Depth Example:</strong> Consider Abram and Eli‛ezer
                of Damascus (Berashith / Genesis 15:2). Abram held the assets,
                but Eli‛ezer was the “steward” (Trustee) of the house. If Abram
                died without an heir, the “Corpus” (the estate) would stay with
                the Trustee to manage. We are the “Eli‛ezers” of Yahuah’s
                property.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Paleo Hebrew Focus:</strong> ADAN (Eden) — meaning
                “Delight” or “Firm Foundation.” The Garden was the first Corpus
                of the Trust.

              <strong>Module 2: Moving from Statutes to Equity</strong>
            </p>
            <ul className="mb-0">
              <li>
                <strong>Concept:</strong> Statutes are “rules of the city”
                (man-made), whereas Equity is “Righteousness” (divine).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scriptural Reference:</strong> Yirmeyahu (Jeremiah)
                31:33 — “I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it
                in their hearts.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In-Depth Example:</strong> In Mattithyahu (Matthew) 12,
                the disciples plucked grain on the Sabbath. By the Statute
                (Pharisaic law), they were “stealing” or “working.” By Equity,
                they were hungry and the Earth belongs to Yahuah, who provides
                for His children. Yahusha used Equity to override the rigid,
                heartless application of man-made religious codes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Maxim of Equity:</strong> Equity regards the intention
                rather than the form (the Father looks at the heart, not just
                the ritual).
              </li>

            <ul className="mb-0">
              <li>
                <strong>Concept:</strong> A Trustee must act with 100% loyalty
                to the Settlor (Yahuah). Any “self-dealing” is a breach of
                Trust.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scriptural Reference:</strong> Tehillim (Psalms) 24:3–4
                — “Who shall ascend into the hill of Yahuah? ... He that hath
                clean hands, and a pure heart.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In-Depth Example:</strong> Gehazi (Melakim Bhet / 2
                Kings 5) secretly took silver for himself. Because he self-dealt
                from the Master’s business, he breached the Trust and received
                the leprosy of Naaman.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Practical Application:</strong> When you sign documents
                in the world, are you signing as a “person” (legal fiction) or
                as a “Trustee” for Yahuah’s estate?

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In-Depth Example:</strong> Israel was sent to Babylon

                Hayyamim Bhet / 2 Chronicles 36:21).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Paleo Hebrew Focus:</strong> ADAMAH (Ground/Earth) — the
                feminine counterpart to Adam. To mistreat the Adamah is to
                mistreat the source of our physical bodies.

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scriptural Reference:</strong> Yochanan (John) 12:24 —
                “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth
                alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.”
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In-Depth Example:</strong> Composting mirrors the
                Gospel: what is “buried” returns as new fertility. Synthetic
                shortcuts distort the natural cycle of increase.
              </li>
              <li>
