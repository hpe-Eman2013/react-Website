          <h2 className="h5 mb-3">Purpose</h2>

          <p className="mb-3">
            To provide a website where people can gain an understanding of who
            Yashar&apos;El is today, and assemble them in worship of the only
            true Elohim, Yahuah.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Christianity has done a masterful job of misleading people to
            worship the Messiah they call &quot;Christ&quot; and the Son of
            Elohim, which they call &quot;Jesus&quot;, according to the way that
            the translators of Scripture, who were influenced by Greek
            philosophy and tradition, choose to render the text.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            We seek to correct this misunderstanding by accurately explaining
            the identity and roles of:
          </p>

          <ul className="mb-3">
            <li>The Father called The Elohim</li>
            <li>The Son of Elohim</li>
            <li>The 12 sons of Ya&apos;aqov (called Jacob)</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Once an accurate understanding of these three entities occurs, the
            scriptures will open to you and illuminate your mind by removing the
            veil that Satan placed over the minds of those perishing (2
            Corinthians 4:3-4).
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            Spreading the truth of The Father, His Son and His people is known
            as the Gospel or Good News of the Kingdom, for in the Kingdom will
            be the reign of the Messiah, the Son of Elohim, the co-heirs (those
            adopted into the family of Elohim by the gift of the Ruach
            Ha&apos;Qodesh (Holy Spirit)), and by the power and authority of
            Yahuah Elohim for a thousand years. It is your duty to share this
            Good News with those you encounter, whether in your families or
            among strangers.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            When we grow in numbers in our local communities, we will request
            members of the Assembly to open their homes for fellowship,
            spiritual direction, education, leadership appointments and Assembly
            organization. This humble and selfless opportunity is a way for a
            member to volunteer their time and resources in promotion of the
            Gospel and ministering to the Qodeshym (set apart ones).
          </p>

          <p className="mb-0">
            The ultimate purpose of this ministry will be fulfilled when all
            members are fully prepared to meet their Messiah, Yahusha, by living
            a life that is pure, without spot or wrinkle (Ephesians 5:27), busy
            doing the works of Elohim and doing good works (Titus 2:7) towards
            their neighbors, showing them how to do the same. May the shalom of
            Elohim be with you and your family as you embark on this journey
            with us!
